Content:

This algorithm was introduced in the paper:
R. S. Medeiros, J. Scharcanski and A. Wong, "Multi-scale stochastic color 
texture models for skin region segmentation and gesture detection," 2013 
IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops (ICMEW).
===========================================================================
INSTALLATION:

The matlab codes are a standalone implementation, and no instalation is needed.
To use the mex (C/C++) implementation of the EM and K-means you must have 
the GSL and BLAS libraries installed on your computer.

GSL: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
BLAS: http://www.netlib.org/blas/

===========================================================================
USAGE:

Run the 'demo_run.m' for segmenting and classifiing the images on the 
folder "img_test". There will be a training stage to build the skin models 
based on the images and groundtruths on the "img_train/" folder.
Run the 'demo_cross.m' for testing cross validation on the images in the 
"img_test/" folder. 

Output will be saved on the "Results/" folder

===========================================================================
FILES:

BiSS 		- Multi-scale decomposition library
demo_run.m	- Train and Classify the test images
demo_cross.m - Run cross validation testes
Images		- Some test Images
README.txt 	- This file
